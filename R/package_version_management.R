#' Obtains the correct version based on the version instruction provided (e.g. \code{>= 0.5}), the package name and it's available versions.
#' If no compatible version is found between the available versions a suitable error is thrown.
#' All different version indications should be handled in this function, including:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item{a version with \code{>} or \code{>=} indicator.}
#'   \item{just a version e.g. \code{'0.5.0'} (most specific)}
#'   \item{a zero length char e.g. \code{''}}
#' }
#'
#' Note that both (1) and (3) are effected by 'pick.last'.
#'
#' @param packVersion A single named version value. i.e. A package name and it's version requirement like: \code{c(dplyr = '>= 0.4.0')}.
#' @param versionList A list of available versions for this package to choose from. It is the list to choose from and check availability. Created with \code{lib.available_versions}.
#' @param packageName  It is used for clear error handling. It should be the package name it is trying to load so we can mention it when crashing.
#' @param pick.last See details.
#' @param warn_for_major_diff If true, it will throw a warning when the requested package is a major release higher than that is specified.
#'
#' @details
#' If a version like \code{>= 0.5} is given and multiple versions exist, a choice needs to be made.
#' By default it will take the same or first higher version (when it exists, just \code{0.5} in the example).
#' This most likely leads to not changing the behaviour of the code. Alternatively, picking the latest version is most
#' likely to be accepted by other packages their dependencies (e.g. if a package that is loaded in the future depends on this package but asks for \code{> 0.6}, it will likely fail).
#' The downside of this is that an update could be a major one, going from \code{0.5} to \code{2.0}, where allot of things can have changed and your code that used to work fine is at risk.
