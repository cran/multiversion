# ============== MAIN FUNCTIONALITY ==============

#' Load package from R_MV_library
#'
#' There are two ways you can provide a package or vector of packages that need to be loaded: \cr
#' 1: just provide them directly (the \code{...} input). All not recognized named variables
#'    will be interpreted as package names or (if it's a named argument) as a package name=version combination. \code{\link{lib.load}(DBI = '0.5', assertthat, R6)}
#' 2: provide the \code{loadPackages} input in the following way: \code{\link{lib.load}(loadPackages = c(DBI = '0.5', assertthat = '', R6 = ''))} \cr
#' \cr
#' If an empty string e.g. \code{dplyr = ''}, or only the package name is specified, one of two things will happen:
#' - if one version is available, this one is used.
#' - if multiple versions are available, the first or last version is loaded depending on the 'pick.last' value (FALSE by default). \cr
#' \cr
#' if >= or > is used, as in \code{dplyr = '>= 2.5'}, it will decide for the first or last compatible version, depending on the 'pick.last' parameter.
#' If another version is desired, please define it in the input list of packages to load, prior to the package that depends on it.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Dependencies are checked by recursively running this function with \code{dry_run = TRUE}.
#' Then the paths of the found dependencies are temporarily appended (\code{.libPaths()}) when the actual package is loaded.
#' This makes that dependencies are not loaded automatically, but are added to the namespace.
#' To access a dependency directly, load it explicitly.
#' Because the \code{.libPaths()} does not include the package it's location, this still needs to be done by \code{lib.load}.\cr
#' In other words, dependencies are remembered, but not loaded.\cr
#' \cr
#' Using \code{dry_run} will show the packages that will be used and will crash when no option is feasible (not installed or not compliant packages).
#' If you are trying to setup a proper \code{\link{lib.load}} call, it is always a good idea to work with dry_run's.
#' Once an incorrect package has been loaded, it is very likely you will have to restart
#' your R session to unload it (\code{Ctrl} + \code{shift} + \code{F10}). Unloading packages in R often leaves traces. \cr
#' \cr
#' The .libPaths of specific package versions can be appended when using 'appendLibPaths = TRUE'.
#' Afterwards, the normal \code{library} call can be used to load the package since it's path is in the \code{.LibPaths} vector.
#' For example: \cr
#' \code{
#' lib.load(c(dplyr = '0.5.0'), dry_run = TRUE, appendLibPaths = TRUE)
#' library(dplyr)} \cr
#' \cr
#' How this works is that \code{dry_run} skips the loading step, and \code{appendLibPaths}
#' adds the paths of dplyr and it's dependencies to \code{.libPaths}, which make a \code{library} call work. \cr
#' \cr
#' One reason to use \code{appendLibPaths = TRUE} is to make these packages accessible by
#' a new 'child' R session. This is the case if \code{devtools::test()} is ran
#' by using \code{cntrl} + \code{shift} + \code{TRUE} in Rstudio. When running it directly,
#' it will use the packages it can find in the available libraries (\code{.libPath()}) and return an error if they cannot be found. \cr
#'
#' The inputs .packNameVersionList [vector of named versions] and .skipDependencies [vector of names] can be
#' left blank in general. They are used internally and might be deprecated in the future.
#'
#' @section Major version differences:
#' By default, when chosing the right version to load, only versions are looked up within the
#' same major version.
#' For example, when \code{pick.last = TRUE}, the version \code{'> 15.3.0'} is requested and
#' the versions \code{c('15.5.0', '15.9.0', '16.0.0')} are available, the version \code{15.9.0} is chosen.
#' When a requested (dependency) version \code{'>= 0.5'} is provided, and only the versions
#' \code{c('0.4.0', '1.5.0', '1.7.0')} are available,
#' it will throw a warning that the first available version is a major release higher,
#' and pick \code{'1.5.0'} or  \code{'1.7.0'} depending on the \code{pick.last} value.\cr
#' \cr
#' This behavior can be disabled by setting \bold{\code{options(mv_prefer_within_major_version = 'no')}}.
#'
#' @section Base packages:
#' The packages within the directory returned by \code{.Library} are considered 'base packages'.
#' Of these, only one version can exist, and these cannot be included in the multiversion library. \cr
#'
#' @section Problem solving:
#' If you receive the error "\code{cannot unload ...}" it means that it tries to load a package,
#' but another version is already loaded.
#' To unload this other (older) version, run detach(package = '...'). If it is a dependency
#' of an other package, you will receive this error.
#' Try restarting your RStudio with a clean workspace (environment). If that doesn't help,
#' the only workaround (when using this in R studio) is to close your Rstudio session (NOTE: save your unsaved process before proceeding!!), rename (or remove) the folder
#' "\code{YourRProject/.Rproj.user/.../sources/prop}" and start Rstudio again. If it doesn't
#' work, try "\code{/sources/per}" also. Where the \code{...} stands for a hash that is used in the current session e.g. \code{/F3B1663E/}.
#' After this, the packages should be unloaded and you should be able to load a new batch of
#' packages. Most times it will suffice to clear the workspace (environment) and reload the project while saving the empty environment.
#'
#' @param ... All packages and their versions you would like to load e.g.
#'   \code{\link{lib.load}(DBI = '0.5', assertthat = '', R6 = '', quietly = TRUE)}.
#'   Input names like \code{quietly} will be recognized and interpreted as expected.
#' @param loadPackages Supports providing a named character vector of packages and their
#'   versions in the shape that is supported by all other functions in this package.
#'   e.g. \code{c(DBI = '0.5', assertthat = '', R6 = '')}
#' @param lib_location The folder containing a structure where this package must load
#'   packages from. By default, it checks the environment variable \code{R_MV_LIBRARY_LOCATION} for this directory.
#' @param dry_run Will make it perform a dry run. It will check all dependencies and
#'   if \code{appendLibPaths} it will add
#' their paths to \code{.libPaths} but it will not load those packages. If the paths
#'   are added this way, you should be able to just call the located packages with \code{library(...)}
#' @param quietly Indicates if the loading must happen silently. No messages and
#'   warnings will be shown if the value is set to true.
#' @param verbose Indicates if additional information must be shown that might
#'   help with debugging the decision flow of this function. More specifically,
#'   when false, it will wrap 'library' calls in \code{suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(...))}
#'   and suppress unloading attempts.
#' @param appendLibPaths When true, the path to every package that is loaded will
#'   be appended to \code{.libPath(...)}. That configured path is the location
#'   where \code{library()} will look for packages. For a usecase for this feature,
#'   see the description above.
#' @param pick.last Changes the way a decision is made. In the scenario where a
#'   dependency of \code{>} or \code{>=} is defined, multiple versions may be
#'   available to choose from. By default, the lowest compliant version is chosen.
#'   Setting this to true will choose the highest version.
#' @param also_load_from_temp_lib when true, it will also load packages from the
#'   temporary installation directory (created when packages are installed in the R_MV_library).
#'   Can be usefull when installing using: \code{lib.install("new package!", install_temporarily = TRUE)}.
#'
#' @param .packNameVersionList See main description. Should be left blank.
#' @param .skipDependencies See main description. Should be left blank.
#'
#' @return Will return a named character vector indicating which version of
#'   which package is loaded (or will be loaded, when dry_run = TRUE).
#'   In general, this function is called for it's side effect. It will load
#'   specific versions of specific packages from a special \code{multiversion} library.
